										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p> I'm a Software engineer based in New York. I love learning and solving problems. <br> I like to write code that looks just as good in Visual Studio Code as it does on the browser. </p> 
										<p>When I'm not coding, I am probably dancing, singing, or having a laugh with my friends. Sometimes, all three at the same time.

										<h2 class="major">Education and Experience</h2>
										<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland with a double-major in Information Systems and Accounting. I went on to work as an IT Risk Consultant at KPMG for over 2 years where I worked with some of the largest financial institutions in the world. </p> 
										<p>After gaining client-facing and management experience in the senior role, I decided to take a deeper dive into creating and developing technology myself. To brush up on my coding skills, I studied full-stack development at the highly selective App Academy where I lived and breathed code for over 80 hours a week for about 5 months.</p>

											<h3 class="major">InFit</h3>
											<p>InFit is a social media web app that lets you store, rate, categorize, and share clothes in your wardrobe. This project was built with a group of 3 other incredible engineers using MongoDB, Express.JS, React/Redux, and Node.JS. </p>
												
												<p>In the role of Team Leader, I was responsible for directing the look, feel, and functionality of the product as well as planning and delegating daily
											tasks for our team. We were able to implement drag and drop technology with the "Beautiful DnD" library for React. InFit's mascot, the InFit Impala, will forever be in my heart.</p>

											<a href="https://kloudclone.herokuapp.com/#/" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/kloudclone.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">KloudClone</h3>
											<p>KloudClone is a clone of the popular music-sharing website SoundCloud. Built with Ruby on Rails and React/Redux. </p>
											<p>This project was really fun to work on because I was able to combine my passion for music with my passion for coding. Figuring out how to leverage React and Redux states in combination with the audio HTML element to develop a stylish and fully functional music-player was a fun challenge. The biggest struggle, though, was having to not completely jam-out every time I was testing my music-player.</p>

											<h3 class="major">League of Data</h3>
											<p>League of Data is a visually compelling data visualizer for data on professional League of Legends
											players of your choosing. The catch? This was built with just Native JavaScript and the D3 Data Visualization library.</p>

											<h3 class="major">PokeSweeper</h3>
											<p>You've played MineSweeper. You've played Pokemon (I hope). Put the two together, and you've got PokeSweeper!
												PokeSweeper was built using React.JS with the amazing engineer Holly Phillips.
